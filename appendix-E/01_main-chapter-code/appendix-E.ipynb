    "#### E.1 Introduction to LoRA\n",
    "###### No code in this section\n",
    "###### Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a machine learning technique that modifies a pretrained model to better suit a specific, often smaller, dataset by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the model's parameters\n",
    "###### This approach is important because it allows for efficient finetuning of large models on task-specific data, significantly reducing the computational cost and time required for finetuning\n",
    "###### Suppose we have a large weight matrix  for a given layer\n",
    "###### During backpropagation, we learn a  matrix, which contains information on how much we want to update the original weights to minimize the loss function during training\n",
    "###### In regular training and finetuning, the weight update is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The LoRA method proposed by Hu et al. offers a more efficient alternative to computing the weight updates  by learning an approximation of it, .\n",
    "###### In other words, in LoRA, we have the following, where  and  are two small weight matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The figure below illustrates these formulas for full finetuning and LoRA side by side\n",
    "\n",
    "###### If you paid close attention, the full finetuning and LoRA depictions in the figure above look slightly different from the formulas I have shown earlier\n",
    "###### That's due to the distributive law of matrix multiplication: we don't have to add the weights with the updated weights but can keep them separate\n",
    "###### For instance, if  is the input data, then we can write the following for regular finetuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Similarly, we can write the following for LoRA:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The fact that we can keep the LoRA weight matrices separate makes LoRA especially attractive\n",
    "###### In practice, this means that we don't have to modify the weights of the pretrained model at all, as we can apply the LoRA matrices on the fly\n",
    "###### After setting up the dataset and loading the model, we will implement LoRA in the code to make these concepts less abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "#### E.2 Preparing the dataset\n",
    "###### This section repeats the code from chapter 6 to load and prepare the dataset\n",
    "###### Instead of repeating this code, one could open and run the chapter 6 notebook and then insert the LoRA code from section E.4 there\n",
    "###### (The LoRA code was originally the last section of chapter 6 but was moved to the appendix due to the length of chapter 6)\n",
    "###### In a similar fashion, we could also apply LoRA to the models in chapter 7 for instruction finetuning"
