#### AWS CloudFormation Template: Jupyter Notebook with LLMs-from-scratch Repo

###### This CloudFormation template creates a GPU-enabled Jupyter notebook in Amazon SageMaker with an execution role and the LLMs-from-scratch GitHub repository.

#### What it does:

###### Creates an IAM role with the necessary permissions for the SageMaker notebook instance.
###### Creates a KMS key and an alias for encrypting the notebook instance.
###### Configures a notebook instance lifecycle configuration script that:
###### Installs a separate Miniconda installation in the user's home directory.
###### Creates a custom Python environment with TensorFlow 2.15.0 and PyTorch 2.1.0, both with CUDA support.
###### Installs additional packages like Jupyter Lab, Matplotlib, and other useful libraries.
###### Registers the custom environment as a Jupyter kernel.
###### Creates the SageMaker notebook instance with the specified configuration, including the GPU-enabled instance type, the execution role, and the default code repository.

#### How to use:

###### Download the CloudFormation template file (cloudformation-template.yml).
###### In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudFormation service.
###### Create a new stack and upload the template file.
###### Provide a name for the notebook instance (e.g., "LLMsFromScratchNotebook") (defaults to the LLMs-from-scratch GitHub repo).
###### Review and accept the template's parameters, then create the stack.
###### Once the stack creation is complete, the SageMaker notebook instance will be available in the SageMaker console.
###### Open the notebook instance and start using the pre-configured environment to work on your LLMs-from-scratch projects.

#### Key Points:

###### The template creates a GPU-enabled (ml.g4dn.xlarge) notebook instance with 50GB of storage.
###### It sets up a custom Miniconda environment with TensorFlow 2.15.0 and PyTorch 2.1.0, both with CUDA support.
###### The custom environment is registered as a Jupyter kernel, making it available for use in the notebook.
###### The template also creates a KMS key for encrypting the notebook instance and an IAM role with the necessary permissions.
