    "#### 7.8 Evaluating the finetuned LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In this section, we automate the response evaluation of the finetuned LLM using another, larger LLM\n",
    "###### In particular, we use an instruction-finetuned 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model by Meta AI that can be run locally via ollama (https://ollama.com)\n",
    "###### (Alternatively, if you prefer using a more capable LLM like GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, please see the llm-instruction-eval-openai.ipynb notebook)\n",
    "###### Ollama is an application to run LLMs efficiently\n",
    "###### It is a wrapper around llama.cpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), which implements LLMs in pure C/C++ to maximize efficiency\n",
    "###### Note that it is a tool for using LLMs to generate text (inference), not training or finetuning LLMs\n",
    "###### Before running the code below, install ollama by visiting https://ollama.com and following the instructions (for instance, clicking on the \"Download\" button and downloading the ollama application for your operating system)\n",
    "###### For macOS and Windows users, click on the ollama application you downloaded; if it prompts you to install the command line usage, say \"yes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Linux users can use the installation command provided on the ollama website\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In general, before we can use ollama from the command line, we have to either start the ollama application or run ollama serve in a separate terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "###### With the ollama application or ollama serve running in a different terminal, on the command line, execute the following command to try out the 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model (the model, which takes up 4.7 GB of storage space, will be automatically downloaded the first time you execute this command)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### # 8B model\n",
    "###### ollama run llama3\n",
    "###### The output looks like as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Note that llama3 refers to the instruction finetuned 8-billion-parameter Llama 3 model\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Using ollama with the \"llama3\" model (a 8B parameter model) requires 16 GB of RAM; if this is not supported by your machine, you can try the smaller model, such as the 3.8B parameter phi-3 model by setting model = \"phi-3\", which only requires 8 GB of RAM\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Alternatively, you can also use the larger 70-billion-parameter Llama 3 model, if your machine supports it, by replacing llama3 with llama3:70b\n",
    "\n",
    "###### After the download has been completed, you will see a command line prompt that allows you to chat with the model\n",
    "\n",
    "###### You can end this session using the input /bye\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The following code checks whether the ollama session is running correctly before proceeding to use ollama to evaluate the test set responses we generated in the previous section"
