    "###### Exercise 7.1: Changing prompt styles\n",
    "###### Suppose we have the following data entry:\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### {\n",
    "######   \"instruction\": \"Identify the correct spelling of the following word.\",\n",
    "######   \"input\": \"Ocassion\",\n",
    "######   \"output\": \"The correct spelling is 'Occasion.'\"\n",
    "###### }\n",
    "###### In the main chapter, we formatted it according to the Alpaca-style prompt template:\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### ### Instruction:\n",
    "###### Identify the correct spelling of the following word.\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### ### Input:\n",
    "###### Occassion\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### ### Response:\n",
    "###### The correct spelling is 'Occasion.'\n",
    "###### In this exercise, we now use the Phi-3 prompt template instead, which formats the data entry as follows:\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### <user>\n",
    "###### Identify the correct spelling of the following word: 'Occasion'\n",
    "###### \n",
    "###### <assistant>\n",
    "###### The correct spelling is 'Occasion'.\n",
    "###### Note that this prompt template is substantially shorter, which reduces the runtime and hardware ###### requirements for finetuning the LLM and generating text since the input prompts are shorter. To make this ###### change, we update the format_input function as follows:"
