    "#### 1) A brief introduction to DPO\n",
    "###### DPO, proposed in the paper Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model, is an alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) used in finetuning large language models (LLMs)\n",
    "###### DPO can be used to finetune (or align) the model to generate responses that better align with user expectations and instructions\n",
    "###### In instruction finetuning, we train the LLM to generate correct answers given a prompt\n",
    "###### However, in practice, there are multiple ways to give a correct answer, and correct answers can differ in style; for example, consider a technical and a more user-friendly response when asking an LLM to give recommendations when buying a laptop, as shown in the figure below\n",
    "###### RLHF and DPO are methods that can be used to teach the LLM to prefer one answer style over the other, that is, aligning better with user preferences\n",
    "###### The RLHF process, which requires training a separate reward model, is outlined below\n",
    "###### Compared to RLHF, DPO aims to simplify the process by optimizing models directly for user preferences without the need for complex reward modeling and policy optimization\n",
    "###### In other words, DPO focuses on directly optimizing the model's output to align with human preferences or specific objectives\n",
    "###### Shown below is the main idea as an overview of how DPO works\n",
    "###### The concrete equation to implement the DPO loss is shown below; we will revisit the equation when we implement it in Python further down in this code notebook\n",
    "###### In the equation above,\n",
    "###### \"expected value\"  is statistics jargon and stands for the average or mean value of the random variable (the expression inside the brackets); optimizing  aligns the model better with user preferences\n",
    "###### The  variable is the so-called policy (a term borrowed from reinforcement learning) and represents the LLM we want to optimize;  is a reference LLM, which is typically the original LLM before optimization (at the beginning of the training,  and  are typically the same)\n",
    "###### is a hyperparameter to control the divergence between the  and the reference model; increasing increases the impact of the difference between  and  in terms of their log probabilities on the overall loss function, thereby increasing the divergence between the two models\n",
    "###### the logistic sigmoid function,  transforms the log-odds of the preferred and rejected responses (the terms inside the logistic sigmoid function) into a probability score\n",
    "###### To avoid bloating the code notebook with a more detailed discussion, I may write a separate standalone article with more details on these concepts in the future\n",
    "###### In the meantime, if you are interested in comparing RLHF and DPO, please see the section 2.2. RLHF vs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in my article Tips for LLM Pretraining and Evaluating Reward Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Preparing a preference dataset for DPO\n",
    "###### Let's begin by loading and preparing the dataset, which may already answer a lot of the questions you might have before we revisit the DPO loss equation\n",
    "###### Here, we work with a dataset that contains more polite and less polite responses to instruction prompts (concrete examples are shown in the next section)\n",
    "###### The dataset was generated via the create-preference-data-ollama.ipynb notebook\n",
