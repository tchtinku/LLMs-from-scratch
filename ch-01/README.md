Chapter 1: Understanding Large Language Models

LLM: 
-> neural n/w designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text.
-> Deep Neural n/w trained on massive amt of text data, sometimes large portion of entire publicly available text.
-> large -> model's size in terms of parameters + datasets
-> Also referred as Gen AI

Stages of building LLM

LLMs -> using PyTorch deep learning libray

general process for LLM creation - pretraining + finetuning

2 categ of fine-tuning
-> instruction fine-tuning
-> classification fine-tuning
