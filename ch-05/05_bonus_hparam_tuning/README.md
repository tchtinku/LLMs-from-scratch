#### Optimizing Hyperparameters for Pretraining

###### The hparam_search.py script, based on the extended training function in Appendix D: Adding Bells and Whistles to the Training Loop, is designed to find optimal hyperparameters via grid search.

###### Note

###### This script will take a long time to run. You may want to reduce the number of hyperparameter configurations explored in the HPARAM_GRID dictionary at the top.
